# Some Thoughts on Dynamic Quantum Clustering

A good friend of mine pointed me in the direction of a clustering algorithm called **Dynamic Quantum Clustering**, or **DQC** for short, which uses ideas from Quantum Mechanics to find the most likely cluster centers in a data set.

I read the original papers and had a few insights of my own, which I'm summarizing in this essay. I may yet write a couple of actual research papers about these insights but that's a decision I haven't made yet.
